 Your Presentation Script & Guide
Here’s a step-by-step guide to explaining your project, "Aegis," to the judges.
## 1. The Introduction (The Hook)
(Slide: Title Page / Project Concept)
What to say:
"Good morning, judges. We are Team Abyss, and today we're here to solve a problem that silently drains time and resources from every university: manual timetable scheduling."
"Our project is called Aegis: The Resilient Scheduling and Workflow System. It’s designed to transform this chaotic process into a smart, fast, and fair system."
## 2. The Problem You're Solving
(Slide: Project Concept)
What to say:
"Right now, what does scheduling look like? It’s a nightmare. Administrators spend weeks manually piecing together timetables, like a giant puzzle with no guide. This leads to two major issues:"
"It’s incredibly slow and inefficient."  
"It's often unfair to teachers. Some are overloaded while others are underutilised, simply because the manual process isn't smart enough to balance the workload fairly."  
## 3. Your Solution: Aegis!
(Slide: Project Concept)
What to say:
"Our solution, Aegis, is an AI-powered tool that completely changes the game. Instead of weeks, it generates multiple, highly-optimised schedules in just minutes. It also streamlines the entire approval process, making everything smooth and transparent."  
## 4. What Makes Aegis Special? (Key Innovations)
(Slide: Key Innovations)
What to say:
"Aegis isn't just another scheduler. We have three key innovations that make it truly smart:"
"First, the Multi-Priority Sliders. This lets the admin decide what's most important. Do they want to maximise classroom usage this semester? Or focus on balancing teacher workload? They can simply adjust the sliders to generate different schedule options based on their goals."  
"Second, the Weighted Workload Score. We believe fairness is crucial. Instead of just counting teaching hours, our system understands that a new course preparation or a large class takes more effort. It calculates a 'true' workload score to ensure every faculty member is treated equitably."  
"And third, the Clash Resolution Wizard. Sometimes, a clash is unavoidable. When this happens, Aegis doesn't just fail. It presents the admin with the top 3 compromise solutions and clearly shows the pros and cons of each choice. This turns a dead-end into a smart decision."  
## 5. How It Works (The Technology Stack)
(Slide: Technology Stack)
This part can be scary, but you don't need to be an expert! Explain it with simple analogies.
What to say:
"Let's talk about the technology that powers Aegis. We've chosen a modern, powerful stack:"
"For the Frontend—what the user sees—we're using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Think of this as the car's dashboard: clean, simple, and easy to use."  
"For the Backend—the engine of our system—we use Python with the Django Framework. This is the powerful brain that handles all the logic."  
"For the Database, we use PostgreSQL, which is like the fuel tank, securely storing all the information about courses, faculty, and rooms."  
"And the magic ingredient is Google OR-Tools. This is our core optimisation engine. Think of it as an expert navigator that can look at millions of possible routes (or schedules) and find the absolute best one in seconds."  
## 6. Explaining The Flowcharts
You have two diagrams. Let's break down how to explain them.
Flowchart 1: The Technical Workflow
(Slide: Technology Stack)
What to say:
"This chart shows how Aegis creates a perfect timetable. It’s a simple, 8-step journey:"
"First, we feed the system the data: all the info on teachers, rooms, and courses."  
"The Admin then sets their priorities using our special sliders."  
"Our Optimization Engine, powered by Google OR-Tools, gets to work, creating the best possible schedules."  
"It instantly checks for clashes."  
"If there are no clashes, it presents the top 3-4 draft timetables for the admin to choose from."  
"If a clash is found, our Resolution Wizard steps in and offers 3 smart compromises."  
"The admin selects the best option and sends it through the Approval Workflow."  
"Once approved, the Official Timetable is published!"  
Flowchart 2: The Strategy
(Slide: Implementation Strategy)
What to say:
"We’ve also thought carefully about how to implement this in a real university. We identified four major challenges and have a solution for each:"
"The Challenge: Getting old data into our new system. Our Solution: Simple CSV/Excel Imports."  
"The Challenge: Getting people to actually use it. Our Solution: An Intuitive UI that is easy to learn and immediately useful."  
"The Challenge: Handling the complex puzzle of scheduling. Our Solution: Google OR-Tools does all the heavy lifting."  
"The Challenge: Making sure it works for a huge university. Our Solution: Async Workers, which are background processes that ensure the system is fast and scalable."  
## 7. The Impact (Why It Matters)
(Slide: Impact and Benefits)
What to say:
"So, what is the real-world impact of Aegis? It's huge."
"For Administrators: We reduce scheduling time by 90%—from weeks to hours. This frees them up for more important strategic work."  
"For Faculty: It creates fair and balanced workloads, which boosts morale and satisfaction."  
"For the University: It maximises the use of classrooms and labs, which saves money and improves the return on investment."  
"For Everyone: It creates a transparent and collaborative process, eliminating confusion and delays."  
## 8. The Conclusion
What to say:
"In conclusion, Aegis is more than just a scheduling tool. It's a complete system that brings efficiency, fairness, and intelligence to a core university process. We are confident that it will not only save institutions valuable time and money but also create a better working environment for their most important asset: their faculty."
"Thank you. We are Team Abyss, and we're now open for any questions."
You are going to be great! Read through these points, understand the flow, and practice saying it out loud. The judges aren't just looking for a technical expert; they're looking for someone who understands a problem and has a clear vision for solving it. You have that!
